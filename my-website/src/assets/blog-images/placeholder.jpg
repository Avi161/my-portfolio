The file /my-website/my-website/src/assets/blog-images/placeholder.jpg is intended to be an image file. Since I cannot generate image files directly, you can create a placeholder image using any image editing software or download a placeholder image from a website that provides free images. 

If you need a specific placeholder image, you can create a simple one using an online tool or software like Photoshop, GIMP, or even a basic drawing application. 

If you need further assistance with the project or any other files, feel free to ask!
